  p1: 'Think about a media environment you engage with regularly—TikTok, news headlines, TV dramas, YouTube comments, etc. Choose one and describe a research question that could be answered through content analysis. What would you want to measure? Would you be more interested in manifest content (what’s there) or latent content (the underlying tone or message), and why?'

One media environment I engage with frequently is Instagram, particularly content related to gentle parenting. This topic has gained significant traction on the platform, with influencers and everyday users sharing videos, infographics, and personal stories that promote a more empathetic and emotionally attuned approach to parenting. A research question I would explore through content analysis is: How is gentle parenting portrayed and received in Instagram posts by top influencers? This question allows for a deeper understanding of both the messaging around gentle parenting and the public’s reaction to it, especially in the comment sections where opinions and debates often unfold.
To conduct this study, I would focus on a sample of high-engagement posts from influencers who consistently share gentle parenting content. These posts often include explanations of parenting strategies, demonstrations of parent-child interactions, or reflections on parenting challenges. I would analyze both the content of the posts and the comments they receive. Specifically, I’d measure the frequency of gentle parenting themes such as emotional validation, non-punitive discipline, and child autonomy. Additionally, I’d examine the sentiment expressed in user comments—whether they are supportive, critical, or neutral—and identify recurring patterns of controversy or disagreement.
While manifest content, such as specific words, hashtags, or emojis, can provide useful surface-level data, I would be more interested in analyzing latent content. Latent content refers to the underlying tone, values, and emotional messaging embedded in the posts and comments. For example, even if a comment doesn’t explicitly criticize gentle parenting, its tone might suggest skepticism or sarcasm, which reveals deeper cultural attitudes. By focusing on latent content, I could uncover how gentle parenting is framed—whether it’s seen as progressive, permissive, idealistic, or unrealistic—and how these perceptions vary across different audiences.
This approach aligns with the principles outlined in Chapter 11 of the coursepack, which emphasizes the importance of defining clear units of analysis and distinguishing between manifest and latent content. In this case, the units of analysis would include individual Instagram posts and their associated comment threads. Coding categories might include emotional tone, parenting values, types of support or criticism, and references to broader social norms. The goal would be to systematically interpret the content in a way that reveals not just what is being said, but how it reflects larger cultural conversations about parenting.
Ultimately, this research could contribute to a better understanding of how social media shapes and reflects parenting ideologies. It could also highlight the role of influencers in promoting certain values and the ways in which audiences engage with or resist those messages. By using content analysis to explore this dynamic media environment, I would gain insight into the evolving discourse around parenting and the emotional and ideological tensions that surface in digital spaces.
