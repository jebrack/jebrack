  p1: 'Think of a broad media-related topic you’ve been curious about—something like influencer culture, algorithmic feeds, or news bias. Now, imagine you’re preparing to research this topic. Would you start with a research question or a hypothesis? Why? Reflect on how much you already know (or don’t know) about the topic, and how that affects whether exploration or prediction is the better fit.'

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->
One media-related topic I’ve been curious about is the impact of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on consumer decisions, especially when it comes to purchasing products that are new to the market. In today’s digital environment, eWOM—such as online reviews, social media posts, and influencer endorsements—has become a powerful force in shaping consumer behavior. While existing research and case studies suggest that positive eWOM can increase the likelihood of purchase, most of these studies focus on established products with a large volume of reviews and consumer feedback. This raises an important question: How do consumers decide to try a product when it is new to the market and lacks substantial eWOM?
To explore this topic, I would begin with a research question rather than a hypothesis. Research questions are especially useful when a topic is still being explored and the researcher does not yet have enough information to make a specific prediction. A hypothesis, on the other hand, is better suited for situations where the researcher has enough background knowledge to make an educated guess about the outcome. Since I am still in the early stages of understanding how eWOM affects consumer behavior for new products, a research question allows me to remain open to multiple possibilities and perspectives.
The chapter also emphasizes the importance of considering how much you already know about a topic when deciding between exploration and prediction. In my case, I’ve read a few case studies that suggest positive eWOM can influence purchasing decisions, but these studies typically involve products with established reputations. What I don’t yet understand is how consumers navigate uncertainty when a product is new and lacks reviews. Do they rely more heavily on influencer recommendations? Are they influenced by early adopters on platforms like TikTok or Reddit? Or do they wait until more feedback accumulates before making a decision?
Because of this uncertainty, an exploratory approach is more appropriate. Starting with a research question like “How do consumers evaluate and decide to purchase a new-to-market product when eWOM is limited?” allows me to investigate the various factors that influence consumer trust and decision-making. These might include the credibility of the source, the format and tone of the eWOM, the platform it appears on, and the consumer’s own prior experiences or risk tolerance.
Once I gather more data and insights, I may be able to refine my focus and develop a hypothesis for further testing. But for now, the goal is to explore the landscape of consumer behavior in the context of emerging products and limited digital feedback. This approach aligns well with the principles outlined in Chapter 6, which encourages researchers to start with curiosity and open-ended inquiry when entering a new area of study.
