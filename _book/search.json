    "text": "2.2 Response\n\nOne claim I recently came across online stated that “Making your bed every day makes you 206% more likely to become a millionaire.” While this statement is catchy and might be intended to motivate people toward discipline and success, I was immediately skeptical of its accuracy. To evaluate whether this claim holds any truth, I would apply the principles of empiricism and control to design a study that could test it objectively. Empiricism is the idea that knowledge should be based on observable and measurable evidence. Rather than accepting the claim at face value, I would gather real-world data to see if there is any actual correlation between bed-making habits and income level. To do this, I would conduct a survey targeting a diverse sample of participants across different age groups, professions, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The survey would collect demographic data such as age, gender, education level, occupation, and current salary range. This would help ensure that the sample is representative and that the results are meaningful. In addition to demographic information, the survey would ask participants about their bed-making habits using a Likert-style scale. The question might be phrased as: “How often do you make your bed in the morning?” with response options including: Always, Most of the time, Sometimes, Rarely, Never. This format allows for a more nuanced understanding of behavior rather than a simple yes/no answer. The principle of control is equally important in designing a reliable study. Control involves accounting for other variables that might influence the outcome. In this case, factors such as education level, industry, geographic location, and work experience could all affect a person’s income independently of whether they make their bed. By controlling for these variables—either through statistical methods or by segmenting the data—I could better isolate whether bed-making has any real influence on financial success. After collecting and analyzing the data, I would look for patterns or correlations between bed-making frequency and income level. If a strong, statistically significant relationship exists even after controlling for other factors, it might suggest that the claim has some merit. However, if no meaningful correlation is found, it would indicate that the claim is likely exaggerated or unfounded. In conclusion, using empiricism and control allows us to move beyond flashy claims and test ideas with evidence. This approach helps ensure that conclusions are based on facts rather than assumptions or viral internet posts.",

    "text": "3.2 Response\n\nIf I were researching public social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, or TikTok, I would generally consider the content posted on these platforms to be public information. These platforms are designed for users to share thoughts, opinions, and media with a broad audience, often with the understanding that their posts may be viewed by strangers, especially if they keep their profiles on public. However, just because content is publicly accessible does not mean it is ethically straightforward to use in research. When analyzing posts from individual users, I believe it is important to approach the situation with sensitivity and respect for privacy. Even if a post is technically public, the user may not expect their content to be cited in academic or professional research. In these cases, I would either seek informed consent from the user or anonymize the post to protect their identity. This includes removing usernames, handles, and any other identifying information. Ethically, this helps avoid exposing individuals to unwanted attention or misinterpretation, especially if the content is personal, controversial, or emotionally charged. On the other hand, when referencing content from businesses or organizations on social media, I would consider that information to be public and appropriate to cite without obtaining consent—especially when the content is focused solely on the company or brand, such as advertising campaigns or promotional posts. Companies typically use social media for marketing, branding, and public communication, and their posts are intended to be seen and shared widely. As such, referencing a business’s post or image in research—especially when analyzing trends, engagement, or branding strategies—does not usually raise the same ethical concerns as citing individual users. That said, digital research presents many ethical gray areas. For example, what if a user deletes a post after it has been archived or cited? What if the content was shared publicly but originated from a private group or context? These scenarios challenge researchers to think critically about consent, context, and the potential impact of their work. Additionally, platforms like Reddit often include pseudonymous users who may not expect their posts to be linked to real-world identities, even if the content is public. What if the content is inappropriate, triggering, or vulgar? In such cases, researchers must carefully evaluate whether including the material serves a meaningful purpose in the study and how its inclusion might affect readers or participants. Sensitivity to context and audience is essential, and steps should be taken to provide content warnings or avoid unnecessary exposure to harmful material. To navigate these complexities, I would follow ethical research guidelines, such as those provided by institutional review boards (IRBs), and prioritize transparency, consent, and anonymity whenever possible. I would also consider the intent behind the post and the potential consequences and risk of including it in my research. Ultimately, ethical digital research requires balancing the accessibility of online content with a deep respect for the individuals behind it.",

    "text": "4.2 Response\n\nThe source of the claim that “one egg a day is equivalent to five cigarettes” was a 2012 study published in the journal Atherosclerosis. The study found that individuals who consumed more than three egg yolks per week had increased plaque buildup in their carotid arteries. The researchers noted that the effect of egg yolks on plaque buildup was about two-thirds that of smoking cigarettes. However, this nuanced finding was sensationalized by media headlines, leading to widespread misinformation. The comparison was taken out of context and used to support various agendas, particularly within vegan advocacy groups and documentaries. Personally, I first encountered this claim in the Netflix documentary Food, Inc., and it stuck with me for nearly a decade. The way it was presented made me question my own dietary choices, even though I later learned the claim was misleading. This documentary is just one example of a larger issue: the frequent spread of exaggerated or misleading health claims, especially those tied to weight loss. Social media platforms are saturated with content pushing weight loss agendas, often targeting vulnerable individuals who are actively seeking help or guidance. These claims are rarely backed by solid evidence and often exploit emotional appeals or fear-based messaging to gain traction. If I were to research this issue without using any theory, I would likely focus only on collecting statistical media data—comparing viewing statistics or engagement analytics. While this might provide some factual insights, it would miss critical dimensions of the issue, such as how and why the misinformation spread, and what factors influenced its acceptance. Without theory, I wouldn’t explore the social, psychological, or cultural dynamics that shape public understanding. Theory helps us ask deeper questions, such as: What role does media framing play in shaping public perception of health risks? How do confirmation bias and identity (e.g., dietary choices, ethical beliefs) affect how people interpret health claims? What mechanisms allow misinformation to gain traction and credibility on social platforms? Using theory—such as media framing theory, health communication models, or social identity theory—would allow me to approach the research more holistically. I would begin with in-depth interviews, asking participants about their confidence in making health-related decisions, where they typically receive health information (e.g., social media or medical professionals), their physical activity levels, and their eating habits. During open coding, I would look for recurring themes in participants’ responses, such as statements like, “I’m always looking to social media for nutrition information that comes from informal videos.” I might code this as “Trusting social media.” As I move into axial coding, I would begin grouping related codes—such as “Not fact-checking” and “Trusting social media”—under broader categories like “Reliance on informal sources” or “Low information verification.” Finally, in the selective coding phase, I would identify a core category—perhaps “Low information verification”—that ties the data together. From there, I could develop a grounded theory suggesting that individuals with low physical activity and low confidence in their health decisions are more likely to rely on unverified nutrition information from social media.",

    "text": "5.2 Response\n\nA media-related topic that interests me is electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) and how it influences consumer behavior and purchase decisions. eWOM refers to any positive or negative statement made by potential, actual, or former customers about a product or company, which is made available to a multitude of people and institutions via the internet. With the rise of social media platforms, eWOM has become a powerful force in shaping consumer perceptions and driving engagement. I recently read the article “Electronic word of mouth and consumer engagement on social media: A literature analysis” by Ismagilova et al. (2020), which provided a comprehensive overview of existing research on eWOM. One of the key takeaways from the article was the identification of several topical voids in the current literature. For example, while many studies have examined the impact of eWOM on purchase intentions, fewer have explored the emotional and psychological mechanisms that underlie consumer responses to eWOM. Specifically, the role of sentiment, tone, and emotional appeal in eWOM messages remains under-researched. This gap is important because emotional content can significantly influence how consumers interpret and act on online reviews and recommendations. Another notable gap is the lack of cross-cultural research in the field. The article points out that most studies on eWOM are conducted in Western contexts, which limits the generalizability of findings. Cultural factors can influence how consumers perceive credibility, trustworthiness, and relevance of eWOM. For instance, collectivist cultures may place more emphasis on community opinions, while individualist cultures may prioritize personal experiences. Exploring these cultural differences could provide a more nuanced understanding of eWOM’s global impact. Additionally, the article highlights a need for more research on platform-specific dynamics. Different social media platforms have unique affordances and user behaviors, which can affect how eWOM is generated, shared, and received. For example, the brevity of Twitter posts versus the visual nature of Instagram content may lead to different consumer engagement patterns. Understanding these platform-specific nuances could help marketers tailor their strategies more effectively. In preparing to write a literature review on eWOM, I would focus on identifying these topical voids and overlooked perspectives as justification for a new study. These gaps matter in media research because they highlight areas where our understanding is incomplete or biased. Addressing them can lead to more inclusive, accurate, and actionable insights. This topic is especially relevant to me personally, as I am in the process of starting my own business and preparing to launch a new product campaign. Understanding how eWOM influences consumer decision-making will be critical in shaping my marketing strategy. Moreover, filling these gaps can help businesses better understand consumer behavior, improve customer engagement strategies, and enhance the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns. Ultimately, identifying and addressing gaps in media research—whether they are topical voids, contradictions, or overlooked perspectives—is essential for advancing the field and ensuring that research remains relevant in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.",

    "text": "7.2 Response\n\nIf I were planning a study on how college students interact with AI tools like ChatGPT, I would choose a non-probability sampling method. This decision is based on both the nature of the research and the practical considerations involved in conducting the study. Since AI tools like ChatGPT are relatively new and rapidly evolving, there is limited existing research and few established theories. Therefore, my study would likely focus on exploratory research questions rather than testing a specific hypothesis. The goal would be to gain a deeper understanding of how students use these tools, what motivates their usage, and how it affects their academic behavior. Non-probability sampling methods, such as convenience sampling or purposive sampling, are well-suited for exploratory research. These methods allow researchers to select participants who are readily accessible or who meet specific criteria relevant to the study. If I were to use convenience sampling, I might distribute my survey electronically to students on a single university campus, targeting those who are easily accessible. Alternatively, if I opted for purposive sampling, I would intentionally select students who are known to use ChatGPT regularly or who are enrolled in courses that promote the use of AI tools. Either of these approaches would help me gather insights from a targeted group, even if the findings are not statistically generalizable to all college students. One of the key trade-offs in choosing non-probability sampling is generalizability. Unlike probability sampling, which uses random selection to ensure that every member of the population has an equal chance of being included, non-probability sampling does not support broad generalizations. However, in the early stages of research—especially when studying emerging technologies—depth of understanding can be more valuable. The insights gained from a focused group can inform future studies that may use probability sampling to test hypotheses on a larger scale. In terms of access, time, and cost, non-probability sampling is often more efficient. Recruiting participants through convenience sampling, for example, can be done quickly and with minimal resources. This is particularly important for student researchers or small teams with limited budgets. Additionally, because AI usage among students may vary widely depending on factors like major, year in school, or familiarity with technology, a purposive sample can help ensure that the study includes participants who are most relevant to the research questions. Chapter 7 emphasizes that sampling decisions should align with the goals of the research. If the aim is to make statistical inferences about a population, probability sampling is ideal. But if the goal is to explore a phenomenon in depth and generate new ideas or theories, non-probability sampling is often more appropriate. In this case, my goal is not to generalize to all college students but to understand how a specific group interacts with ChatGPT. Therefore, non-probability sampling offers the flexibility and focus needed to conduct meaningful research in a timely and cost-effective way.",

    "text": "6.2 Response\n\nOne media-related topic I’ve been curious about is the impact of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on consumer decisions, especially when it comes to purchasing products that are new to the market. In today’s digital environment, eWOM—such as online reviews, social media posts, and influencer endorsements—has become a powerful force in shaping consumer behavior. While existing research and case studies suggest that positive eWOM can increase the likelihood of purchase, most of these studies focus on established products with a large volume of reviews and consumer feedback. This raises an important question: How do consumers decide to try a product when it is new to the market and lacks substantial eWOM? To explore this topic, I would begin with a research question rather than a hypothesis. Research questions are especially useful when a topic is still being explored and the researcher does not yet have enough information to make a specific prediction. A hypothesis, on the other hand, is better suited for situations where the researcher has enough background knowledge to make an educated guess about the outcome. Since I am still in the early stages of understanding how eWOM affects consumer behavior for new products, a research question allows me to remain open to multiple possibilities and perspectives. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of considering how much you already know about a topic when deciding between exploration and prediction. In my case, I’ve read a few case studies that suggest positive eWOM can influence purchasing decisions, but these studies typically involve products with established reputations. What I don’t yet understand is how consumers navigate uncertainty when a product is new and lacks reviews. Do they rely more heavily on influencer recommendations? Are they influenced by early adopters on platforms like TikTok or Reddit? Or do they wait until more feedback accumulates before making a decision? Because of this uncertainty, an exploratory approach is more appropriate. Starting with a research question like “How do consumers evaluate and decide to purchase a new-to-market product when eWOM is limited?” allows me to investigate the various factors that influence consumer trust and decision-making. These might include the credibility of the source, the format and tone of the eWOM, the platform it appears on, and the consumer’s own prior experiences or risk tolerance. Once I gather more data and insights, I may be able to refine my focus and develop a hypothesis for further testing. But for now, the goal is to explore the landscape of consumer behavior in the context of emerging products and limited digital feedback. This approach aligns well with the principles outlined in Chapter 6, which encourages researchers to start with curiosity and open-ended inquiry when entering a new area of study.",
