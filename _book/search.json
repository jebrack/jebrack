    "text": "2.2 Response\n\nOne claim I recently came across online stated that “Making your bed every day makes you 206% more likely to become a millionaire.” While this statement is catchy and might be intended to motivate people toward discipline and success, I was immediately skeptical of its accuracy. To evaluate whether this claim holds any truth, I would apply the principles of empiricism and control to design a study that could test it objectively. Empiricism is the idea that knowledge should be based on observable and measurable evidence. Rather than accepting the claim at face value, I would gather real-world data to see if there is any actual correlation between bed-making habits and income level. To do this, I would conduct a survey targeting a diverse sample of participants across different age groups, professions, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The survey would collect demographic data such as age, gender, education level, occupation, and current salary range. This would help ensure that the sample is representative and that the results are meaningful. In addition to demographic information, the survey would ask participants about their bed-making habits using a Likert-style scale. The question might be phrased as: “How often do you make your bed in the morning?” with response options including: Always, Most of the time, Sometimes, Rarely, Never. This format allows for a more nuanced understanding of behavior rather than a simple yes/no answer. The principle of control is equally important in designing a reliable study. Control involves accounting for other variables that might influence the outcome. In this case, factors such as education level, industry, geographic location, and work experience could all affect a person’s income independently of whether they make their bed. By controlling for these variables—either through statistical methods or by segmenting the data—I could better isolate whether bed-making has any real influence on financial success. After collecting and analyzing the data, I would look for patterns or correlations between bed-making frequency and income level. If a strong, statistically significant relationship exists even after controlling for other factors, it might suggest that the claim has some merit. However, if no meaningful correlation is found, it would indicate that the claim is likely exaggerated or unfounded. In conclusion, using empiricism and control allows us to move beyond flashy claims and test ideas with evidence. This approach helps ensure that conclusions are based on facts rather than assumptions or viral internet posts.",

    "text": "Prompt A: Choose either the Nazi medical experiments or the Tuskegee syphilis study and reflect on what that case teaches us about the need for ethical safeguards in research. Why do you think these events had such a lasting impact on how research is conducted today? How might studying these cases shape your behavior as a future researcher?\n\n\nPrompt B: Imagine you are researching a public social media platform like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, or TikTok. Would you consider the content you’re analyzing to be public or private? Would you need to obtain informed consent? Why or why not? Reflect on the ethical gray areas that emerge in digital research and how you would navigate them.\n\n\nPrompt C: Think ahead to a study you might conduct as part of this course. What would it look like to fully honor the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in your research? Identify at least one concrete action you would take during your study’s design or data collection to uphold each of these three ethical principles.",

    "text": "4.2 Response\n\nThe source of the claim that “one egg a day is equivalent to five cigarettes” was a 2012 study published in the journal Atherosclerosis. The study found that individuals who consumed more than three egg yolks per week had increased plaque buildup in their carotid arteries. The researchers noted that the effect of egg yolks on plaque buildup was about two-thirds that of smoking cigarettes. However, this nuanced finding was sensationalized by media headlines, leading to widespread misinformation. The comparison was taken out of context and used to support various agendas, particularly within vegan advocacy groups and documentaries. Personally, I first encountered this claim in the Netflix documentary Food, Inc., and it stuck with me for nearly a decade. The way it was presented made me question my own dietary choices, even though I later learned the claim was misleading. This documentary is just one example of a larger issue: the frequent spread of exaggerated or misleading health claims, especially those tied to weight loss. Social media platforms are saturated with content pushing weight loss agendas, often targeting vulnerable individuals who are actively seeking help or guidance. These claims are rarely backed by solid evidence and often exploit emotional appeals or fear-based messaging to gain traction. If I were to research this issue without using any theory, I would likely focus only on collecting statistical media data—comparing viewing statistics or engagement analytics. While this might provide some factual insights, it would miss critical dimensions of the issue, such as how and why the misinformation spread, and what factors influenced its acceptance. Without theory, I wouldn’t explore the social, psychological, or cultural dynamics that shape public understanding. Theory helps us ask deeper questions, such as: What role does media framing play in shaping public perception of health risks? How do confirmation bias and identity (e.g., dietary choices, ethical beliefs) affect how people interpret health claims? What mechanisms allow misinformation to gain traction and credibility on social platforms? Using theory—such as media framing theory, health communication models, or social identity theory—would allow me to approach the research more holistically. I would begin with in-depth interviews, asking participants about their confidence in making health-related decisions, where they typically receive health information (e.g., social media or medical professionals), their physical activity levels, and their eating habits. During open coding, I would look for recurring themes in participants’ responses, such as statements like, “I’m always looking to social media for nutrition information that comes from informal videos.” I might code this as “Trusting social media.” As I move into axial coding, I would begin grouping related codes—such as “Not fact-checking” and “Trusting social media”—under broader categories like “Reliance on informal sources” or “Low information verification.” Finally, in the selective coding phase, I would identify a core category—perhaps “Low information verification”—that ties the data together. From there, I could develop a grounded theory suggesting that individuals with low physical activity and low confidence in their health decisions are more likely to rely on unverified nutrition information from social media.",
